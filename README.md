OVERVIEW: The project 
PROCESS EXPLANATION: First, I took a collection of photos that I put through a google colab notebook to train it and generate ai images using our own database. We then trained another ai to generate text based off of anothet text. In my case, I used Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky. I created the first draft or excercise in Adobe Premiere Pro which we did not have access on on our personal computers so I restarted and switched over to creating it on the phone with another editing app I was more used to, albeit not as high quality and effective as Adobe Premiere Pro. It has a lot less effects and features. 
DATA SET: My dataset had a wide variety of images I deemed as "anthropocene". This would include buildings with vines growing on them, wires and antennas travelling into the ground and around trees, plants, pipes, etc. I chose this dataset to try and have a wide variety of items the ai could train from and therefore give me broader and more interesting results which did happen. I had about 65 photos in total that I fed into the ai.
WHY THIS PROCESS, RESULT, AND DATASET:
