# Assignment 3
<p>OVERVIEW: This project explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and artistic expression. By diving into the fascinating world of AI training, we'll learn how to use these models to generate unique images and text. We then take these outputs and weave them into a cohesive and meaningful art project. This project is a chance to not only learn a new skill but to also explore the creative potential of AI and discover new ways to communicate and express ourselves through art.</p>p>
<p></p>PROCESS EXPLANATION: First, I took a collection of photos that I put through a google colab notebook to train it and generate ai images using our own database. We then trained another ai to generate text based off of anothet text. In my case, I used Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky. I created the first draft or excercise in Adobe Premiere Pro which we did not have access on on our personal computers so I restarted and switched over to creating it on the phone with another editing app I was more used to, albeit not as high quality and effective as Adobe Premiere Pro. It has a lot less effects and features.</p>
<p></p>DATA SET: My dataset had a wide variety of images I deemed as "anthropocene". This would include buildings with vines growing on them, wires and antennas travelling into the ground and around trees, plants, pipes, etc. I chose this dataset to try and have a wide variety of items the ai could train from and therefore give me broader and more interesting results which did happen. I had about 65 photos in total that I fed into the ai.</p>
</p>WHY THIS PROCESS, RESULT, AND DATASET:</p>
<p></p>Brief reflection about the outcome: what were your intentions? What do you want to provoke? and what are your inspirations?</p>
